# Random-Number-Generator-except-8-is-a-gooner-one-
just random numbers (if its 8 ur a gooner)

how's this works?
the file using a basic random numbers like import random (random.randrange(1, 10))
so python lets us to generator randomly as we get the numbers (but if ur get 8, you're a gooner /j)
its actually a fun script so dont be /srs for this :P
